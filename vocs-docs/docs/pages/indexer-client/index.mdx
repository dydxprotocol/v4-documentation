# Indexer API

The Indexer is a high-availability system designed to provide structured data. It serves both over its [HTTP/REST API](/indexer-client/http) for spontaneous requests and over its [WebSockets API](/indexer-client/websockets) for continuous data streaming.

See the [guide](/interaction/endpoints#indexer-client) on how to use the available Indexer client to learn how to connect to it.
