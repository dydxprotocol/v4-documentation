# Accounts

All of your trading activity is associated with your account which corresponds to an address.
In dYdX, accounts are also composed by subaccounts. All trading is done through a subaccount. See more on the [Accounts and Subaccounts](/concepts/trading/accounts) page.

## Account Data

An account can have multiple subaccounts. To fetch all known (with some activity) subaccounts associated with an account the account's address is required.

:::code-group

```python [Python]
response = await indexer.account.get_subaccounts(ADDRESS)
```

```typescript [TypeScript]
const response = await indexer.account.getSubaccounts(ADDRESS);
```

```rust [Rust]
let subaccounts = indexer.accounts().get_subaccounts(address).await?;
```

:::

To fetch a specific subaccount, use the account's address the the subaccount number.

:::code-group

```python [Python]
# Fetch subaccount '0' information.
subaccount_resp = await indexer.account.get_subaccount(ADDRESS, 0)
```

```typescript [TypeScript]
// Fetch subaccount '0' information.
const subaccountResp = await indexer.account.getSubaccount(ADDRESS, 0);
```

```rust [Rust]
// Fetch subaccount '0' information.
let subaccount_resp = indexer.accounts().get_subaccount(&subaccount).await?;

```

:::

### Balance

The responses above will contain information such as the subaccount's equity, also known as the total account value. Your equity is a combination of the account's USDC balance and sum of the open positions values. A minimum amount of funds is required to trade, see more on [Margin](/concepts/trading/margin) and [Equity Tier Limits](/concepts/trading/limits/equity-tier-limits).

:::code-group

```python [Python]
subaccount = subaccount_resp["subaccount"]
print("Equity: ", subaccount["equity"])
print("Open positions: ", subaccount["openPerpetualPositions"])
```

```typescript [TypeScript]
const subaccount = subaccountResp.subaccount;
console.log('Equity: ', subaccount.equity);
console.log('Open positions: ', subaccount.openPerpetualPositions);
```

```rust [Rust]
println!("Equity: {:?}", subaccount_resp.equity);
println!("Open positions: {:?}", subaccount_resp.open_perpetual_positions);
```

::::note
dYdX is built on the Cosmos SDK and therefore has related methods available. To see the balances of your assets/tokens please see the methods below.
::::details[Cosmos Bank Balances]

Get the account balance of all assets types (currently USDC and dYdX tokens).

:::code-group

```python [Python]
response = await node.get_account_balances(ADDRESS)
```

```typescript [TypeScript]
const coins = await node.get.getAccountBalances(ADDRESS);
```

```rust [Rust]
let balance = client
    .get_account_balances(&address)
    .await?;
```

:::

The balance of a specific asset can also be fetched instead.

:::code-group

```python [Python]
# `adv4tnt` is the dYdX token (testnet) denomination.
response = await node.get_account_balance(ADDRESS, "adv4tnt") # [!code focus]
```

```typescript [TypeScript]
// `adv4tnt` is the dYdX token (testnet) denomination.
const coins = await node.get.getAccountBalance(ADDRESS, "adv4tnt"); // [!code focus]
```

```rust [Rust]
// `adv4tnt` is the dYdX token (testnet) denomination.
let balance = node // [!code focus]
    .get_account_balance(&address, &"adv4tnt".parse()?) // [!code focus]
    .await?; // [!code focus]
```
