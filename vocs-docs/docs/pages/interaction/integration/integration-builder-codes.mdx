# Builder Codes

Builder codes enables external parties to submit orders to dYdX and collect fees (per-order) for building and routing an order to the exchange.
The address and fee, in parts per million, needs to be configured via the `BuilderCodeParameters` in the order message itself. The fee will be paid out when the given order is filled.

Builder fees and addresses can be queried via the indexer using the `/orders` and `/fills` endpoints as usual. `/orders` contains details on the fee rate and builder address. `/fills` also contains the builder address as well as details on the amount charged per-fill.


## Changes To The Order Message

::::steps

## BuilderCodeParameters
`BuilderCodeParameters` is an addition to the order message which will specify:
    - `partner address` - where fees will be routed
    - `fee (in ppm)` that will be charged on order matching

```go
message Order {
  // The unique ID of this order. Meant to be unique across all orders.
  OrderId order_id = 1 [ (gogoproto.nullable) = false ];
	
	...
	
	// builder_code is the metadata for the partner or builder of an order.
  BuilderCodeParameters builder_code_params = 12;
}

// BuilderCodeParameters represents the metadata for the 
// partner or builder of an order. This allows them to 
// specify a fee for providing there service
// which will be paid out in the event of an order fill.
message BuilderCodeParameters {
  // The address of the builder to which the fee will be paid.
  string builder_address = 1;

  // The fee enforced on the order in ppm.
  uint32 fee_ppm = 2;
}
```

:::note
`BuilderCodeParameters` is an optional field

## Order Validation Checks
    - Ensure the `builder address` is valid
    - Ensure the `feePPM` is in the range `(0, 10,000]`
