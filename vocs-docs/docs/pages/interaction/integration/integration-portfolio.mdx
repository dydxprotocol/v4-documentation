# User Portfolio

After onboarding to dYdX and depositing funds, the app displays the portfolio view. Once the user places a trade, the app updates to show open positions.


## Portfolio Data Display Fields

![portfolio1](/portfolio1.png)

![portfolio2](/portfolio2.png)


(a) `Account equity`: 
Indexer data from the websocket `v4_parent_subaccounts` channel. [response](/types/parent_subaccounts_update_message). 
This is equity of subaccount 0 (e.g., the sum of all child subaccount equities).

(b) `Account PnL`: 
`Account PNL` of the selected time range (e.g., it’s “7 days” on the screenshot). 
Indexer data [GetHistoricalPnlForParentSubaccount](/indexer-client/http#get-parent-historical-pnl). Sample curl request:

```bash
curl --location 'https://indexer.v4testnet.dydx.exchange/v4/historical-pnl/parentSubaccountNumber?address=dydx1k93udthd0vtzjk465f846qzea3fzq7axnmfqyz&parentSubaccountNumber=0'
 ```
(c) `max buying power`:
The endpoint returns the PNL ticks of the given time range. The value is the difference between the last and first tick.


Account level buying power.  The Indexer provides data via the WebSocket `v4_parent_subaccounts` channel. [response](/types/parent_subaccounts_update_message).

#### Calculate max leverage 
Each market has a configured maximum leverage factor ranging from 1x to 50x. The leverage factor is derived from the `initialMarginFraction` field in the market info received from the WebSocket [v4-markets](/indexer-client/websockets#markets) channel.

```bash
max leverage = 1 / initialMarginFraction
```

#### Max Buying power
The `max buying power` is then calculated as follows:
- Take the `freeCollateral` of `subaccount 0`
- Multiply it by the `maximum leverage` across all markets (50x)

This represents the user's maximum buying power if all remaining free collateral is applied to the market with the highest leverage.

::::

(d) `Account level risk`
This metric represents the `percentage of the user's total collateral` that has been allocated to support open positions (also referred to as `margin`).
The account-level risk is derived from Indexer data via the WebSocket `v4_parent_subaccounts` channel. [sample response](/types/parent_subaccounts_update_message).  

To compute `total collateral`, follow these steps:

::::steps 

#### Collateral per position
Calculate the collateral for each open position:

```bash
position collateral = (current value of the position) * leverage = (position size * current oracle price) * leverage
```

#### Sum collateral
Sum up the collaterals for all open positions.

#### Total collateral
Add the USDC asset position of subaccount 0, which represents the remaining USDC balance that hasn’t been used as collateral for open positions.

The resulting `total collateral` is then used to determine the `margin percentage`, reflecting the level of risk associated with the account’s open positions.

(e) `Historical PNL`.  Indexer data [GetHistoricalPnlForParentSubaccount](/indexer-client/http#get-parent-historical-pnl).  The chart shows the PNL tickets of the selected time range.

(f) `Position size, and position side`   Indexer data from the websocket  `v4_parent_subaccounts` channel.  [sample response]([response](/types/parent_subaccounts_update_message)).  Subaccount -> ChildSubaccounts -> openPerpetualPositions -> size/side.

(g) `Current oracle price`.  From market data off the Websocket [v4-markets](/indexer-client/websockets#markets) channel.

(i (img 1)) `Perp 24h price change percentage`:  From market data off the Websocket [v4-markets](/indexer-client/websockets#markets) channel, priceChange24H field of childSubaccount.

(i (img 2)) `Position USDC size`.  Position size * oracle price

(j) `Position PNL`. (Position size * oracle price) - (Position size * entry_price)

(k) `Current funding rate`.  netFunding, of childSubaccount.

(l) `Entry price`.  entryPrice, of childSubaccount

(m) `Liquidation price`.  When the market price moves across this estimated price, the user's position would be liquidated. See [margining requirements](/concepts/trading/margin)


## History

The trade history data come from the Indexer’s [getfillsforparentsubaccount](/indexer-client/http#get-parent-fills) endpoint. 
Transfer history data come from the Indexer’s [gettransfersforparentsubaccount](/indexer-client/http#get-parent-transfers) endpoint.
