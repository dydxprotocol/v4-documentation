# Market data

## Market data

The client application typically displays a list of tradable and launchable markets as follows:

![markets1](/markets1.png)

![markets2](/markets2.png)

The market list can be obtained from the Indexer in two ways:
1. REST API: Call `GET` [/perpetualMarkets](/indexer-client/http#get-perpetual-markets).
2. WebSocket Subscription: Subscribe to the [v4-markets](/indexer-client/websockets#markets) channel (preferred, as it provides real-time updates).

Additionally, the client should call `metadata-service/v1/info` to retrieve static market data, such as market icons and other metadata.

### Market Data Display Fields

(a)`Market Icon`: Extracted from the logo field in the `metadata-service/v1/info` response.

(b) `Market Name`: Derived from the name field in `metadata-service/v1/info` or directly from the market token name in the Indexer data.

(c) `Oracle Price`: Provided by the Indexer.

(d) `Perp 24h Price Change (%)`: Available in the Indexer’s `priceChange24H` field.

(e) `Perp Trade Volume`: Extracted from the Indexer’s `volume24H` field.

(f) `Spot Market Cap`: Found in the `market_cap` field of the `metadata-service/v1/prices` response.

(g) `User’s Buying Power`: Determined by applying collateral to the market (explained in the user-specific data section).

(h) `Perp Open Interest`: Retrieved from the Indexer’s `openInterest` field.

(i)` Perp Funding Rate`: Available in the Indexer’s `nextFundingRate` field.

(j) `Market Descriptions`: Sourced from the `v4-localization` repository, using the token ID as the key.

(k) `Market Info Links`: Obtained from the url field in `metadata-service/v1/info`.

## Candles

The candles data come from the websocket `v4-candles` channel.   To subscribe the channel, supply the following parameters:

```bash
{
“id”: “ETH-USD/1HOUR”
“batch”: “true
}
```

Supply the id field with the market ID and the [candle resolution](/types/candle_resolution).  Parse [CandleResponse](/types/candle_response_object) to get the list of the candle values.

![candles](/candles.png)

(a) `Candlestick`.  Use the `high`, `low`, `open` and `close` field from each data point.  See [here](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/candlestick-charting-what-is-it/) for candles.

(b) `Volume`.  Use the `usdVolume` field.

(c) `Candle resolution` [candle resolution](/types/candle_resolution). 


## Orderbook

The orderbook data come from the websocket [v4_orderbook](/indexer-client/websockets#orders) channel, which gives a list of asks and bids:

```bash
"bids": [    
  {       
 "price": "28194",       
 "size": "4.764826096"     
  },
  ...
],
"asks": [    
  {       
 "price": "28294",       
 "size": "5.764826096"     
  },
  ...
],
```

### Order Book Displaying Fields

![orderbook](/orderbook.png)

(a) `Size of the order`

(b) `Price of the order`


### Order Book Color
- `Darker green bar`: Represents the size of an `individual order`.
- `Light green bar`: Represents the `depth at this price`, calculated as the `sum of all order sizes` that would have been taken before this order is crossed. 
See [here](https://academy.youngplatform.com/en/trading/order-book/) for depth.

### Handling WebSocket Updates

When the `WebSocket channel` sends an update, the client `must update the order book` in memory using the order price as the key.

::::steps
#### Add/Update/Delete Entries
- `Add or update` an entry if the backend sends an order with a non-zero size.
- `Remove` an entry if the backend sends an order with `zero size` (indicating the order was canceled or taken).

#### Remove Crossed Entries
- After updating the order book, the client should `remove any crossed entries` when the lowest ask price > highest bid price.
- This ensures that only valid bid-ask pairs remain in the order book.
