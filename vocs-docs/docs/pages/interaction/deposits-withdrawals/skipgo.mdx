- **Assets:** USDC, ETH, POL

## Min & Max Transfer Sizes

| Source Chain     | Min Transfer (USD) | Max Transfer (USD) |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Ethereum Mainnet | \~$0.05            | \~$1,000,000       |
| Other EVM Chains | \~$0.05            | \~$1,000,000       |

## Process Flow (Deposit)

1. **Connect your wallet** to the dYdX interface and navigate to the "Deposit" section
2. **Enter the amount** you wish to transfer (First time 1.25 USDC will be kept in wallet for gas fees)
3. **Choose source chain and asset** you wish to deposit
4. **Review the transaction details** including estimated fees and finality time
5. **Confirm and sign** the transaction from your wallet
6. **Third-party protocol interactions begin:**
   - If your source token is not USDC, an automatic swap occurs via integrated DEXs
   - Funds are sent to bridge contracts (CCTP, Axelar, etc.) based on optimal route
   - These bridges rely on external validators and relayers to verify cross-chain transactions
7. **Wait for confirmation** across all involved networks (may take 10-20 minutes)
   - Multiple relayer networks and validators must reach consensus
   - Each bridge and network has its own finality period
8. **Once confirmed**, funds are available in your dYdX account
   - Relayers monitor and trigger the final IBC transfer to dYdX Chain
