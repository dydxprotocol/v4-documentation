# Quick start with Python

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and start using the `dydx` client library.

Below you will use existing example provided with `dydx` Python client.

::::steps

## Install Python3 and Poetry

Choose and install [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs#installing-with-the-official-installer) for your system.

## Clone the dydx client repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dydxprotocol/v4-clients.git
```

## Set up virtual environment (Only for Linux)

It's a good practice to use virtual environment to isolate dependencies for a project. Run the following command to create virtual environment.

```bash
python -m venv myenv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

After activation, you should see the environment name in the terminal prompt, indicating you are in a virtual environment.

## Adding the `dydx` Dependency

Use the `pip install` command to add the dependencies. It will install the latest version of the client.

```bash
pip install dydx-v4-client
```

For more details on the `dydx-v4-client` library installation, please check the [readme of the python client](https://github.com/dydxprotocol/v4-clients/tree/main/v4-client-py-v2/README.md).

## Install poetry

The `dydx` uses `poetry` library for dependency management. Install the poetry using `pip`.

```bash
pip install poetry
```

## Install all dependencies

Go to the Python client library.

```bash
cd v4-clients/v4-client-py-v2
```

Install the project dependencies using the following command:

```bash
poetry install
```

## Run an example

Now, we can run an example file. Let's run `example/accounts_endpoint.py` file.

```bash
python examples/account_endpoints.py
```

**Now, you can play around with all the available examples. Happy trading!**
