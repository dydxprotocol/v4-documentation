# Quick Start with TypeScript

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and start using the dYdX API TypeScript library.

::::steps

## Install Node and npm

Choose and install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) for your system.

## Clone the dydx client repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dydxprotocol/v4-clients.git
```

## Run an example

Go to the TypeScript client library.

```bash
cd v4-clients/v4-client-js
```
Install and use required node version using `nvm`

```bash
nvm install
nvm use
```

Install and build the examples

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Now, we can run an example file. Let's run `example/accounts_endpoint.js` file.

```bash
node ../build/examples/account_endpoints.js
```

**Now, you can play around with all the available examples. Happy trading!**
