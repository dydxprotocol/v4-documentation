# Cosmovisor

`cosmovisor` is a small process manager for Cosmos SDK application binaries that monitors the governance module for incoming chain upgrade proposals. If it sees a proposal that gets approved, `cosmovisor` can automatically download the new binary, stop the current binary, switch from the old binary to the new one, and finally restart the node with the new binary.

We recommend validators to use `cosmovisor` to run their nodes. This will make low-downtime upgrades smoother, as validators don’t have to manually upgrade binaries during the upgrade. Instead, they can pre-install new binaries, and `cosmovisor` will automatically update them based on the onchain software upgrade proposals.

## Configuration

When Cosmovisor activates an upgrade, it does a backup of the entire data directory by default. This backup can take a very long time to process unless the user does aggressive historical-state-pruning using the `pruning` [configuration on the node](../running-node/required-node-configs.mdx).

As long as you have access to a previous state [snapshot](../running-node/snapshots.mdx), we recommend setting the environment variable `UNSAFE_SKIP_BACKUP` to `true` which skips the data backup and allows a much faster upgrade. If your node is configured to only keep a small amount of historical state, then you may be able to get away with running the backup quickly.

More information about Cosmovisor settings can be found in the [Cosmovisor documentation](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/tooling/cosmovisor).

## Installation

### Using go install

To install the latest version of `cosmovisor`, run the following command:

```bash
go install cosmossdk.io/tools/cosmovisor/cmd/cosmovisor@latest
```

### Manual Build

You can also install from source by pulling the cosmos-sdk repository and switching to the correct version and building as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk.git
cd cosmos-sdk
git checkout cosmovisor/vx.x.x
make cosmovisor
```

This will build Cosmovisor in `/cosmovisor`
 directory. Afterwards you may want to put it into your machine's PATH like as follows:

```bash
cp cosmovisor/cosmovisor ~/go/bin/cosmovisor
```

To check your Cosmovisor version, run

```bash
cosmovisor version
```

## Directory structure

```
.
├── current -> genesis or upgrades/<name>
├── genesis
│   └── bin
│       └── $DAEMON_NAME
└── upgrades
    └── <name>
        ├── bin
        │   └── $DAEMON_NAME
        └── upgrade-info.json
```

## Initializing Cosmovisor

1. Rename binary to `dydxprotocold`

```bash
mv dydxprotocold.<version>-<platform> dydxprotocold
```

2. Set the environment variables

```bash
export DAEMON_NAME=dydxprotocold
export DAEMON_HOME=<your directory>
```

3. The directory structure can be initialized with

```bash
cosmovisor init <path to executable>
```

- `DAEMON_HOME` should be set to the **validator’s home directory** since Cosmovisor polls `/data/` for upgrade info.
- `DAEMON_NAME` should be set to `dydxprotocold`

## How to run

`cosmovisor` is simply a thin wrapper around Cosmos applications. Use the following command to start a testnet validator using `cosmovisor` .

```bash
cosmovisor run arg1 arg2 arg3 ...
```

All arguments passed to `cosmovisor run` will be passed to the application binary (as a subprocess). `cosmovisor` will return `/dev/stdout` and  `/dev/stderr` of the subprocess as its own.

Example:

```bash
cosmovisor run start —log-level info —home /dydxprotocol/chain/.alice
```

runs

```bash
dydxprotocold start —log-level info —home /dydxprotocol/chain/.alice
```

as its subprocess.
