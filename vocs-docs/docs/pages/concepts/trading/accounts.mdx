# Accounts and Subaccounts

Accounts and subaccounts serve as identifiers in the dYdX ecosystem.

## Main Account

A (main) account is associated with a public-private keypair, and with a trader's on-chain identity.

* Known publicly and associated with an address;
* Holds tokens/assets that are sent to/from the chain, including tokens used for gas and collateral;
* Gas for transactions is used from the main account;
* Main accounts cannot trade;
* Several main accounts can be derived from the same mnemonic phrase. Each user main account is completely independent and private/unlinkable from each other.

## Subaccounts

Subaccounts provide a way to isolate funds and manage risk within an account. They are used to trade.

* Each main account can have 128,001 subaccounts;
* Each subaccount is uniquely identified using as subaccount ID of `(main account address, integer)`;
* Once you deposit funds to a valid subaccount ID, the subaccount will automatically be created;
* Only the main account can send transactions on behalf of a subaccount;
* Subaccounts do not require gas (no gas is used for trading);
* Subaccounts require collateral token (currently USDC) in order to trade.
