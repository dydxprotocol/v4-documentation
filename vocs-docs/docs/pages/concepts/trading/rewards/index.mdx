# Rewards, Fees and Parameters

## Rewards

There are several reward mechanisms available with the protocol software.

![Rewards Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dydxprotocol/v4-documentation/refs/heads/main/artifacts/rewards_overview.png)


|                 | Target Users         | Rewards paid in     | Claim Process | Frequency               |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- |
| Staking Rewards | Validators & Stakers | USDC & NATIVE_TOKEN | Manual        | Per Block               |
| Trading Rewards | Traders              | NATIVE_TOKEN        | Automatic     | Per Block (with trades) |

## Staking Rewards

- Rewards distributed to `Validators` and `Stakers` (= Delegators)
- `Staking Rewards = Trading Fees + Gas Fees - Community Tax - Validator Commission`
- Distributed automatically every block
- Must be claimed manually

See more on [Staking Rewards](/concepts/trading/rewards/staking-rewards).

## Trading Rewards

- Rewards distributed to `Traders` after each successful trade
- Based on a specified `formula` with several inputs
- Distributed automatically every block with successful trades
- Claimed automatically

See more on [Trading Rewards](/concepts/trading/rewards/trading-rewards).

## Fees
_The fee schedule is subject to adjustments by the applicable Governance Community_

The basic structure for fees have been developed to reflect the following characteristics:

1. Fees differ based on side (maker/taker)
2. Users are eligible for lower fees based on their 30 day trading volume across sub accounts and markets
3. Fees are uniform across all markets

| Tier  | 30d Trailing Volume                     | Taker (bps) | Maker (bps) |
|-------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1     | < $1M                                  | 5.0             | 1.0                                    |
| 2    | ≥ $1M                                  | 4.5             | 1.0                                    |
| 3   | ≥ $5M                                  | 4.0             | 0.5                                    |
| 4    | ≥ $25M                                 | 3.5             | —                                      |
| 5     | ≥ $125M                                | 3.0             | —                                      |
| 6    | ≥ $125M and ≥0.5% exchange mkt. share  | 2.5             | -0.5                                   |
| 7   | ≥ $125M and ≥1% maker mkt. share       | 2.5             | -0.7                                   |
| 8  | ≥ $125M and ≥2% maker mkt. share       | 2.5             | -0.9                                   |
| 9    | ≥ $125M and ≥4% maker mkt. share       | 2.5             | -1.1                                   |

## Parameters

_Below is a summary of various notable parameters and what they mean for any chain utilizing the open source software. Parameters will be subject to adjustments by the applicable Governance Community and can be set to different values at Genesis by any deployer._

**Bank Parameters**

This parameter establishes whether transfers for any tokens are enabled at Genesis. Transfers will be enabled. 

**State Parameters**

The open source software will not pre-populate any bank-state on the network. Validators who participate in Genesis have the ability to determine the network’s initialized state. 

**Slashing Parameters**

These parameters establish punishments for detrimental behavior by validators.

|                 | Signed Blocks Window | Min Signed Per Window | Downtime Jail Duration | Slash Fraction Doublesign | Slash Fraction Downtime |
| --------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Slashing Params | 8192 (-3 hrs)        | 20%                   | 7200s                  | 0%                        | 0%                      |

_SignedBlocksWindow_: Together with MinSignedPerWindow, specifies the number of blocks a validator must sign within a sliding window. Failure to maintain MinSignedPerWindow leads to validator being jailed (removed from active validator set). 

_SlashFractionDownTime_: Defines the slashing-penalty for downtime 

_DownTimeJailDuration_: How long before the validator can unjail themselves after being jailed for downtime.

Double-signing by a validator is considered a severe violation as it can cause instability and unpredictability in the network. When a validator double-signs, they are slashed for SlashFractionDoubleSign, jailed (removed from validator set) and tombstoned (cannot rejoin validator set). 

**Distribution Parameters**

These parameters handle the  distribution of gas and trading fees generated by the network to validators. 

|                     | Community Tax | WithdrawAddrEnable |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| Distribution Params | 0%            | True               |

_CommunityTax_: Fraction of fees that goes to the community treasury. The software will initially reflect a 0% community tax.

_WithdrawAddrEnabled_: Whether a delegator can set a different withdrawal address (other than their delegator address) for their rewards.

**Staking Parameters**

These parameters define how staking works on the protocol and norms around staking.

*MaxValidators and UnbondingTime are particularly subject to change based on public testnet data and feedback. 

|                 | BondDenom                         | MaxValidators | MinCommissionRate | Unbonding Time |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
| Slashing Params | Decided at Genesis, by validators | 60            | 5%                | 30 days        |

_MaxValidators_: Every block, the top MaxValidators validators by stake weight are included in the active validator set.

_UnbondingTime_: Specifies the duration of the unbonding process, during which tokens are in a locked state and cannot be transferred or delegated (the tokens are still “at stake”).

_MinCommissionRate_: The chain-wide minimum commission rate that a validator can charge their delegators. The default commission rate will be 100%.

**Governance Parameters**

These parameters define how governance proposals can be submitted and executed. For more information on the governance module and its associated parameters, head to the official [Cosmos SDK docs](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.47/modules/gov#parameters).

|            | Min Deposit             | MinInitialDepositRatio | Max Deposit Period | Voting Period | Quorum | Threshold | Veto  |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ | ------------- | ------ | --------- | ----- |
| Gov Params | 10,000 governance token | 20%                    | 1 Days             | 4 Days        | 33.4%  | 50%       | 33.4% |
