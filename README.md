## Documentation Guidelines

1. **Adding Sections to the Table of Contents (TOC)**

    To add new sections to the Table of Contents, update the configuration file `vocs.config.ts`. Make sure to modify the appropriate section of the config so that your new pages or sections appear correctly in the TOC.

2. **Pages Location**

    All documentation pages are located in the `docs/pages` directory. Each page should be added there, following the structure defined in the TOC configuration.

3. **Types Location**

    All types are stored in a separate folder: `docs/pages/types`. The types are used in tables of parameters for methods.

4. **Using the Template**

    A predefined template is available and should be used as the basis for creating all new pages. This ensures consistency in structure and style throughout the documentation.
