# Security

## Independent Audits

The protocol has been audited by the [Informal Systems](https://informal.systems/) team. Additional audits are planned as more protocol code is developed.

You can find all finalized audit reports in the [v4_chain audits folder](https://github.com/dydxprotocol/v4-chain/tree/main/audits).

## Bug Bounty

With all core dYdX Chain (v4) software GitHub repos now made public, we are inviting the community to help us identify any vulnerabilities to improve the security of dYdX Chain.
