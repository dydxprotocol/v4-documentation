# Minimum Specs

The minimum recommended specs for running a node is the following:

- 8-core, x86_64 architecture processor
- 64 GiB RAM
- 500 GiB of locally attached SSD storage

For example, an AWS instance like the `r6id.2xlarge`, or equivalent.

# Ethereum RPC Endpoint

For the chain to process bridge transactions from Ethereum, Ethereum testnet, or other chain that supports the `eth_getLogs` RPC method, the bridge daemon queries an RPC endpoint for logs emitted by the bridge contract. By default, a node will use a public testnet endpoint that may have rate-limiting, low reliability, or other restricted functionality.

For your node to successfully ingest bridge transactions from the relevant blockchain, you are required to specify your own private RPC endpoint with flag `--bridge-daemon-eth-rpc-endpoint <YOUR_PRIVATE_RPC_ENDPOINT>` in the command you run when starting the node.

ðŸ’¡IMPORTANTðŸ’¡:The RPC endpoint you choose *MUST* satisfy the following requirements
* supports `eth_chainId` method
* supports `eth_getLogs` method
* supports `"finalized"` as an input to `toBlock` parameter (Erigon is currently the only major Ethereum node software that does not support this.)
