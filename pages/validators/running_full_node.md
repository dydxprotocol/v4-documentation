# Running a Full Node

### Save your Chain ID in `dydxprotocold` config

Save the [chain-id](../network/network_constants.md#chain-id). This will make it so you do not have to manually pass in the chain-id flag for every CLI command.

```bash
dydxprotocold config chain-id $CHAIN_ID
```

### Getting a Snapshot

See [snapshot service](../network/resources.md#snapshot-service).

### Starting a Full Node

Find the seed node's ID and the IP address from [Resources](../network/resources.md#seed-nodes). Then, run the following command to start a non-validating full node.

For example,
```bash
dydxprotocold start --p2p.seeds="..." --bridge-daemon-eth-rpc-endpoint="<eth rpc endpoint>" --non-validating-full-node=true
```

ðŸ’¡**Note**: if you want to disable gRPC on your full node, it is important to start the node with the
`--non-validating-full-node=true` flag. Otherwise, the application will require that gRPC be enabled.


## Staying up-to-date with the Latest State

### Connecting to Healthy Peers

In order for the full node to have the latest state, it needs to connect to peers which have the latest state Use the following links to get a list of live peers which have the latest state

https://polkachu.com/live_peers/dydx

Update `persistent_peers`  in the config.toml file to include a randomly selected list of 5 peers from the list of live peers obtained using the links above

### Snapshots

Snapshots contain a compressed copy of the chain data which allow the full node to bootstrap to a recent state in the blockchain. A list of snapshot services can be found here https://docs.dydx.exchange/network/resources#snapshot-service. 

### State sync (Alternative to snapshots)

State Sync enables a new node to join the network by obtaining a snapshot of the application state from a state sync node at a recent height. This eliminates the need to fetch and replay all historical blocks. A list of state sync services with instructions are listed below

### Address Book

The **`addrbook.json`** file is used to store configuration details that help a node connect to other peers in the network more efficiently. This can be obtained from the one of the below services and needs to be stored in the `config` folder.

## Pruning Settings

For optimal storage, use the following pruning setting in the app.toml file:

```bash
# 2 latest states will be kept; pruning at 10 block intervals.
pruning = "everything"
```

If the full node is being used for historical queries, a custom strategy should be used to maintain more states. This will increase storage requirements.
