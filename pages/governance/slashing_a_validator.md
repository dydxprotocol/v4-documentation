# Slashing a validator

The chain supports slashing of misbehaving validators through governance vote.

## Proposal Message

The proposal should contain a single [MsgSlashValiator](https://github.com/dydxprotocol/v4-chain/blob/protocol/v4.0.0/proto/dydxprotocol/govplus/tx.proto#L19) message for each validator that should be slashed. See the inline comments for details on each field.

**ðŸ’¡ Important: Both `tokens_at_infraction_height` and `slash_factor` must be set correctly, otherwise undelegations and redelegations might be slashed disproportionately to the rest of the validator's stake.**

### Example Proposal Json

Below is an example proposal JSON file to propose a slashing a validator's total bonded tokens (= total stake, which includes both user delegated and self-delegated) by 0.2 at block height 5000. In other words:
* assuming that the proposal passes governance vote
* assuming that the validator has 1000 total bonded tokens at height 5000
* once the block height reaches 5000, the validator will lose 200 tokens
