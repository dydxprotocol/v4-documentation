# Quickstart

## Getting Started

### Installation

The `v4-client-js` uses node v18 for development. 
You can use nvm to manage different versions of node.

```bash
nvm install
nvm use
nvm alias default $(nvm version) # optional

# You can run the following commands to ensure that you are running the correct `node` and `npm` versions.
node -v # expected: v18.x.x (should match .nvmrc)
npm -v  # expected: 8.x.x
```

Now install the V4 Client
```bash
# Install the v4 client for Typescript
npm i @dydxprotocol/v4-client-js
```

### Setup an example repository

#### 1. Clone or fork the examples repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:dydxfoundation/solutions-public.git
```

#### 2. Go to one of the examples and Setup your mnemonic

- Go to `v4-client-js/examples`
```bash
cd v4-client-js/examples
```
- Copy the `.env.example` under `/src` and rename as `.env` file.
  Now make sure to fill in the following parameters:

```bash
# Network parameters
ADDRESS=your_dydx_address_here
MNEMONIC=your_mnemonic_here
NETWORK_TYPE=testnet # Use "mainnet" for main network
```

- For testnet, feel free to use `DYDX_TEST_MNEMONIC` from the official TS client library under `v4-client-js/examples/constants`.

#### 3a. Run the scripts with node

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

You should now see a `/build` dir generated with JS files. We will use node to run these scripts

- Open a terminal to run the example orders.

```bash
node build/orderExample.js
```

- (OPTIONAL) Run the websocket to check orders for a given subaccount.

```bash
node build/websocketExample.js
```

#### 3b. Run the scripts with ts-node

Alternatively you can run directly with ts-node for development purpose.

```bash
npm install
npm install typescript ts-node
```

- Open a terminal to run the example orders.

```bash
node build/orderExample.js
```

- (OPTIONAL) Run the websocket to check orders for a given subaccount.

```bash
node build/websocketExample.js
```
