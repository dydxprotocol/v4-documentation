# Getting Started with the TypeScript Client

## Quickstart guides

There are multiple quickstart guides to get you up and running with the TypeScript client library for dYdX V4. 

### Run examples from the v4-client-js repository
- Clone and run the examples from the v4-client-js repository. See the following [guide](https://github.com/dydxprotocol/v4-clients/tree/main/v4-client-js#readme) to run TS client examples from the [Typescript client repository](https://github.com/dydxprotocol/v4-clients/tree/main/v4-client-js). 


### Setup your own project
- Install and use the v4-client-js code as a package (in your own software) for your own [example project](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/solutions-public/tree/main/v4-client-js/examples), which you can modify freely
and iterate on for your API trading use cases.
