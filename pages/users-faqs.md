# FAQ Documentation

Since the inception of dYdX Chain, we have been compiling a list of questions and answers from users related to technical support. We turned this list into a live _v4 Telegram Questions_ document, which should be able to answer many of your more nuanced questions.

It's a large document, so we recommend CTRL+F to find key words. 

You can anonymously access the live document with [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QZE5aemQ1lzBN_2RA8-tTVk5JVQ_fNNB4VeSEWKWl8w/edit?usp=sharing).
