## What is the Order Entry Gateway Service (OEGS)
The Order Entry Gateway represents the next step in dYdX’s multi-stage performance evolution:

1. Designated proposers — A governance-selected subset of validators responsible for proposing blocks. This creates a predictable topology for faster routing (available in v9 software upgrade).
2. Order Entry Gateway Service (OEGS) — specialized nodes for direct, one-hop delivery to proposers (available after v9 upgrade).

The Order Entry Gateway Service (OEGS) is open-sourced infrastructure that provides a direct, optimized path from traders to the proposer set, reducing latency, increasing throughput, and lowering barriers for professional and retail traders alike.
OEGS is now live on testnet, reach out to us for more information.

## 1. Previous State
In dYdX previous architecture (original blog post [here](https://www.dydx.xyz/blog/v4-technical-architecture-overview)), orders from traders — whether via the web app, mobile, API, or third-party integration — are submitted to full nodes, which then gossip them across the network until they reach the current block proposer.

- **Pros**: Fully decentralized, no single point of routing.

- **Cons**: Multi-hop gossip introduces latency and unpredictability.

To achieve competitive speeds, professional trading firms have had to typically run their own private full nodes with streaming enabled, directly injecting orders into the gossip layer.

**Previous State** — orders flow through full nodes, then across an unpredictable set


### Validator and Full Node Roles
Validators drive consensus, maintain an off-chain in-memory order book, gossip transactions across the network, and propose blocks following a weighted round-robin proof of stake model.

Full Nodes run the same protocol software but hold no staking power—they don’t vote or propose. They gossip transactions, process committed blocks, and stream blockchain state to the Indexer—a read-optimized service that powers trading UIs with order book and trade data. 

### Why Professional Traders run Full Nodes
Full-node access has become a performance necessity for high-speed trading — but it also represents a high barrier to entry—technical, financial, and operational.

Running a full node means orders don’t need to traverse geo-distributed public RPCs — you eliminate middle-hop latency by injecting them directly into the gossip network.

Full nodes also enable real-time streaming of L3 order book updates, fills, taker orders, and subaccount changes—via gRPC or WebSocket—supporting highly responsive UI or algorithmic trading logic.

Historically, traders relying solely on the public Indexer have faced reliability and uptime challenges, making self-hosted nodes the only way to guarantee consistent, low-latency market data. Since April 2025, we've made huge [improvements](https://x.com/AntonioMJuliano/status/1924593158165344628) (98%!) to API performance and reliability.

## 2. Designated Proposers
We recently introduced the concept of designated proposers (blog post [here](https://www.dydx.xyz/blog/governance-controlled-path-reliability-and-performance)) — a governance-selected subset of validators responsible for proposing blocks. This change to the open-source software creates a predictable topology, making it possible to route transactions directly to the next proposer instead of broadcasting widely. This is a fully deterministic enhancement to CometBFT that brings increased resilience, network performance, and operational clarity — while preserving the full validator set, stake-based voting power, and decentralized governance of the network.

## 3. The Order Entry Gateway Service (OEGS)
The OEGS builds on the designated proposer model by creating a specialized set of gateway nodes that:

- Peer directly with all designated proposers.
- Accept orders via public, high-performance endpoints (gRPC).
- Bypass standard gossip, broadcasting orders in a single hop to the proposer set.

This infrastructure built to:

- Simplify access – traders can send orders to a public, high-performance gRPC endpoint instead of deploying their own nodes.
- Ensure fairness – the Gateway peers directly with validator nodes, improving routing latency and propagation uniformity.
- Scale gracefully – governance can update, expand, or delegate the Gateway set without disrupting overall network topology.

Gateway nodes streamline communication between traders and proposers, replacing the need for multiple gossip hops with direct and parallel message delivery.

## How It Works: Infrastructure Flow
1. Trader submits an order via UI, API, or third-party partner integration to the OEGS.
2. OEGS full nodes processes validation checks (similar to regular full node).
3. Gateway is persistently peered with the proposer set—gossiping the order directly, bypassing standard gossip hops due to direct peering.
4. Designated proposers include it in the next proposed block by consensus.
5. Order fills are committed on-chain; full nodes and Indexers update their state accordingly.

This streamlined flow ensures minimal latency while preserving decentralization and consensus integrity.

### Deployment Options
dYdX Labs plans to fully open-source the OEGS code and infrastructure requirements. Any community deployed infrastructure (e.g., front-end, mobile app, API) could consider sending orders to the OEGS but this remains fully opt-in. 
Traders may still send orders directly to a full node which maintains decentralization and censorship-resistence. Governance may consider additional incentives for an OEGS operator, given their elevated role and service expectations.

### For Market Makers & Traders
You’ll get the benefit of ultra-low-latency order routing and immediate streaming data—without the burden of node deployment or uptime management. It levels the playing field between solo operators and well-resourced trading firms.

## Getting Started
Head over to the OEGS endpoints [here](/interaction/endpoints) or take a look at the Node client Python example [here](/interaction/endpoints#node-client).

OEGS complements full-node streaming, validators’ performance, and indexer infrastructure. We’re planning further enhancements to scale alongside trader needs.
