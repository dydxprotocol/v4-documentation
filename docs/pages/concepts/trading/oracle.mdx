# Oracle Prices

Oracle prices are aggregated prices that provide up-to-date price data for different assets. The oracle price for each trading pair is used for the following:
- Ensuring that each account is well-collateralized after each trade
- Determining when an account should be liquidated
- Triggering "triggerable" order types such as Stop-Limit and Take-Profit orders

## How are oracle prices determined on dYdX Chain?

Oracle prices are determined by the current validator set of the network. 
1. each validator runs a sidecar that pulls prices from oracle providers external exchange prices, such as Binance, Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Bybit, Coinbase, crypto.com, GateIO, ...  the entire list is shown [here](https://github.com/skip-mev/connect-mmu/blob/main/local/config-dydx-mainnet.json)
2. each validator submits their view of oracle prices through vote extensions (some caveats here where there's a max number of markets that can be updated per block, minimum threshold on price changes, etc.)
3. proposer proposes prices by aggregating these vote extensions
4. network accepts a block
5. oracle prices update
