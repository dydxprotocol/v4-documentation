# Quantums and Subticks


In dYdX, quantities and prices are represented in quantums (for quantities) and subticks (for prices), which need conversion for practical understanding.

## Quantums

The smallest increment of position size. Determined from `atomicResolution`.

atomicResolution - Determines the size of a quantum. [For example](https://github.com/dydxprotocol/v4-testnets/blob/aa1c7ac589d6699124942a66c2362acad2e6f50d/dydx-testnet-4/genesis.json#L5776), an `atomicResolution` of -10 for `BTC`, means that 1 quantum is `1e-10` `BTC`.

## Subticks

Human-readable units: `USDC/<currency>` e.g. USDC/BTC

Units in V4 protocol: `quote quantums/base quantums` e.g. (`1e-14 USDC/1e-10 BTC`)

Determined by `quantum_conversion_exponent`, this allows for flexibility in the case that an asset’s prices plummet, since prices are represent in subticks, decreasing `subticks_per_tick` would allow for ticks to denote smaller increments between prices.

E.g. 1 `subtick` = `1e-14 USDC/1e-10 BTC` and if BTC was at 20,000 USDC/BTC, a `tick` being 100 USDC/BTC (`subtick_per_tick` = 10000) may make sense.

If BTC drops to 200 USDC/BTC, a `tick` being 100 USDC/BTC no longer makes sense, and we may want a `tick` to be 1 USDC/BTC, which lets us set `subtick_per_tick` to 100 to get to a `tick` size of 1 USDC/BTC.

## Interpreting block data

::::steps
### Buy or Sell
First, notice row I is negative. That means this trade is a sell by the taker account. If It was positive, it would be a buy.


### Market determination
Next, look at row N. The perpetual_id is 7, which maps to AVAX-USD market. You can see all the mappings from this endpoint for the dYdX Chain deployment by dYdX Operations Services Ltd. https://indexer.dydx.trade/v4/perpetualMarkets where the clobPairId is the perpetual_id.

### Quantity determination
Next, we need to get the decimals for this market. First, get the atomicResolution from that endpoint above which we see is -7. Now we can get the size of the trade. From row I and J, take this number -500000000 and multiply by 10^(AtomicResolution) and you get: -500000000 x 10^-7 = 50, so the quantity is 50.

### Price determination
Next, look at row, E, F, G, H, I, and J

![Interpret2](/interpret_block_data_2.png)

The price of the trade is either `abs((G+E)/I)*10e(-6 - AtomicResolution)`, or `abs((H+F)/J)*10e(-6 - AtomicResolution)`, either one is the same. Note that the ‘-6’ is because the AtomicResolution of USDC is -6.

`abs((1479130125 + 369875)/-500000000)*10e(-6 + 7) = 29.59`

`abs((-1479337255 - 162745)/500000000)*10e(-6 +7) = 29.59`

### Conclusion
In conclusion, we have determined that this trade is SELL 50 AVAX-USD at price $29.59
