## Equity Tier Limits

Subaccounts have a limited number of stateful open orders at any one time determined by the net collateral of the subaccount.

These limits are subject to governance. The latest limits can be queried via the `https://<REST_NODE_ENDPOINT>/dydxprotocol/clob/equity_tier` endpoint.

Here is an example response:

```
  "equity_tier_limit_config": {
    "stateful_order_equity_tiers": [
      {
        "usd_tnc_required": "0",
        "limit": 0
      },
      {
        "usd_tnc_required": "20000000",
        "limit": 10
      },
      {
        "usd_tnc_required": "100000000",
        "limit": 20
      },
      {
        "usd_tnc_required": "1000000000",
        "limit": 40
      },
      {
        "usd_tnc_required": "10000000000",
        "limit": 100
      },
      {
        "usd_tnc_required": "50000000000",
        "limit": 200
      }
    ]
}
```

| Net Collateral            | Long-term / Conditional orders   | 
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------  |
| < $20                     |  0                               |    
| >= $20 and < $100         |  10                              |  
| >= $100 and < $1,000      |  20                              | 
| >= $1,000 and < $10,000   |  40                              | 
| >= $10,000 and < $100,000 |  100                             | 
| >= $100,000               |  200                             |

For example up to 20 open stateful orders across all markets for a subaccount with a net collateral of $2,000.

Note:
- Short term orders, including limit `Immediate-or-Cancel`, `Fill-or-Kill`, and market orders on the frontend do not have this limitation.
- Only the `stateful_order_equity_tiers` field is in effect -- short term order equity limits under the `short_term_order_equity_tiers` key are no longer in effect.
