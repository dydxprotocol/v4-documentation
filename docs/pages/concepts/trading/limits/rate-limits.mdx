# Rate Limits

## Block Rate Limits
:::note
All rate limits are subject to change. The latest limits can be queried via the `https://<REST_NODE_ENDPOINT>/dydxprotocol/clob/block_rate` endpoint.

Note that rate limits are applied per account. That is, subaccounts under the same account share the same rate limit.

Here is an example response:

```
{
    "block_rate_limit_config": {
        "max_short_term_orders_per_n_blocks": [],
        "max_stateful_orders_per_n_blocks": [
            {
                "num_blocks": 1,
                "limit": 2
            },
            {
                "num_blocks": 100,
                "limit": 20
            }
        ],
        "max_short_term_order_cancellations_per_n_blocks": [],
        "max_short_term_orders_and_cancels_per_n_blocks": [
            {
                "num_blocks": 5,
                "limit": 4000
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

### Active Fields

`max_stateful_orders_per_n_blocks`: How many stateful order **place** attempts (successful and failed) are allowed for an account per N blocks. Note that the rate limits are applied in an AND fashion such that an order placement must pass all rate limit configurations.

`max_short_term_orders_and_cancels_per_n_blocks`: How many short term order **place and cancel** attempts (successful and failed) are allowed for an account per N blocks. Note that the rate limits are applied in an AND fashion such that an order placement must pass all rate limit configurations.

### Deprecated Fields

These fields are not used at this time.

`max_short_term_order_cancellations_per_n_blocks`
`max_short_term_orders_per_n_blocks`

### Examples

Examples assume the values in the provided example response.

* 2 long-term orders can be placed for each of the first 10 blocks and then a new long-term order would be rate limited on the 11th block since the limit of 20 long-term orders over the past 100 blocks would apply.
