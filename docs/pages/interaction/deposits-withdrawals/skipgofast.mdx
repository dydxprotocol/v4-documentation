# Skip Go Fast (`Instant Deposit`)

Skip Go Fast is a **decentralized bridging protocol**, developed by **Skip**, that enables **rapid and secure cross-chain transactions** across major blockchain ecosystems such as Ethereum, Cosmos, and Solana. Go Fast accelerates cross-chain actions by up to 25 times, **reducing onboarding times from 10+ minutes to seconds**. Learn more [here](https://docs.skip.build/go/advanced-transfer/go-fast#go-fast).

## Supported Chains & Assets

- **Chains:** Ethereum Mainnet, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, Optimism, Polygon
- **Assets:** USDC, ETH, POL

## Min & Max Transfer Sizes

| Source Chain     | Min Transfer (USD) | Max Transfer (USD) |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Ethereum Mainnet | 50                 | 100,000            |
| Arbitrum         | 10                 | 100,000            |
| Base             | 10                 | 100,000            |
| Optimism         | 10                 | 100,000            |
| Polygon          | 10                 | 100,000            |

:::info
If starting with an asset that is not USDC, Skip Go will swap the asset to USDC on the source chain, and the post-swap amount is used to determine if it falls within the min/max transfer size limits.

## Fees

:::info

- As of 24/6 Ethereum deposits > $100 route via skip go fast by default and are free of fees.
- As of 8/7 EVM L2 deposits > $20 route via skip go fast by default and are free of fees.
  All other routes go via skip regular
  :::

All Skip Go Fast `10 bps` on the transfer size \+ source chain fee:

| Source Chain     | Fee (USD)                          |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Ethereum Mainnet | \~$2.5 (depends on gas fees)       |
| Arbitrum         | \~$0.01-$0.1 (depends on gas fees) |
| Base             | \~$0.01-$0.1 (depends on gas fees) |
| Optimism         | \~$0.01-$0.1 (depends on gas fees) |
| Polygon          | \~$0.01-$0.1 (depends on gas fees) |

## Process Flow (Deposit)

1. **Connect your wallet** to the dYdX interface and navigate to the "Deposit" section
2. **Enter the amount** you wish to transfer (ensure it meets minimum requirements)
3. **Choose the source chain and asset** you wish to deposit
4. **Review the transaction details** including estimated fees and finality time
5. **Confirm and sign** the transaction from your wallet
6. **Skip Go Fast protocol's solvers** monitor for confirmation of fund arrival at Noble
   - This process relies on Skip's decentralized solver network
   - If your source token is not USDC, an automatic swap occurs via integrated DEXs
7. Once confirmed, funds are automatically sent to dYdX Chain via IBC transfer
   - This step uses IBC relayers to complete the cross-chain transfer
8. Final step Funds are moved from the main account to the subaccount for trading
   - This internal transfer is handled by dYdX Chain’s infrastructure

## How Skip Go Fast Works

Skip Go Fast uses a solver-based approach to achieve near-instant finality:

:::steps

#### **User Intent Submission**

- When you initiate a transfer, you call the `submitOrder` function on the protocol contract
- This broadcasts your intent to transfer assets across chains
- Your intent specifies the assets, destination address, and any additional message payload

#### **Solver Network**

- Permissionless participants called "solvers" watch for these intents
- Solvers evaluate whether they can fulfill your intent based on:
  - Their available liquidity on the destination chain
  - Potential reward for fulfilling the intent
- When a solver agrees to fulfill your intent, they use their own capital to front the assets

#### **Instant Fulfillment**

- The solver calls the `fillOrder` function on the destination chain
- This transfers the specified assets and processes any additional actions
- From your perspective, the assets appear on the destination chain almost instantly

#### **Settlement Process**

- After fulfilling your transfer, the solver initiates settlement to recover their fronted assets
- The protocol verifies the solver's actions via a cross-chain messaging system
- Once confirmed, the solver receives their assets back plus any earned fees
- This settlement happens in the background and doesn't affect your user experience.
