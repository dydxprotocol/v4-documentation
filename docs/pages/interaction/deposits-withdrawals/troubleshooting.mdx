# Withdrawal and Deposit Troubleshooting

## **Common Deposit Issues**

::::steps
#### **Funds not appearing in your dYdX account**
   - Verify transaction succeeded on source blockchain explorer
   - Check Noble explorer for IBC transfer confirmation
   - Ensure you've connected the correct wallet to dYdX interface; this is important for the autosweeping to happen from noble to dYdX chain and to sweep into your dYdX subaccount
   - Check [skip explorer](https://explorer.skip.build/) or [Range Tracker Tool](https://usdc.range.org/usdc) to see if relayers have picked up your transaction
   - Wait at least 30 minutes for all confirmations to complete
#### **Transaction stuck or pending**
   - For EVM chains, check if gas price was too low
   - Verify if transaction was rejected on source chain
   - For Skip bridges, check status on [skip explorer](https://explorer.skip.build/) or [Range](https://usdc.range.org/usdc) to see if relayers have picked up your transaction
   - Check if relayer networks are experiencing delays or outages
   - Verify all involved third-party services are operational
#### **Insufficient funds error**
   - Ensure you're accounting for network fees in addition to transfer amount
   - Verify minimum transfer requirements are met
   - For swaps, account for price impact and slippage
#### **Failed at swap stage**
   - Check if the DEX had sufficient liquidity for your swap
   - Verify slippage settings were appropriate for market conditions
   - Consider trying another deposit method that doesn't require a swap

#### **Skip Transaction Troubleshooting**
   - [Skip Documentation Portal](https://docs.skip.build/go/general/transaction-support)
   - Input _tx_hash_ and source chain _chain_id_ into [Skip API](https://explorer.skip.build/)
#### **CCTP Troubleshooting Guide**
   - [skip explorer](https://explorer.skip.build/)
   - [Circle CCTP Status Page](https://status.circle.com)
   - [USDC Tracker Tool](https://usdc.range.org/usdc)
   - [dYdX Chain Explorer](https://www.mintscan.io/dydx)

   - [IBC Relayer Status](https://ibc.range.org)
#### **Relayer issues**
   - Check status pages for relayer networks involved in your transaction
   - Wait for relayer networks to resume normal operation if experiencing downtime
   - Consider using an alternative deposit method if persistent issues occur

### Troubleshooting bridging issues
If you encounter persistent bridging issues, follow these steps:

::::steps
#### **Identify where your funds are currently located**
   - Use block explorers for each relevant chain (source, Noble, dYdX)
   - For Skip transactions, check the `transfer_asset_release` field in the [API response](https://docs.skip.build/go/api-reference/prod/transaction/get-v2txstatus)
#### **Try manual recovery methods if needed**
   - For IBC: Use Keplr or Leap wallet to manually complete pending transfers
   - For CCTP: Follow the manual process described in the CCTP section
   - For Skip: Contact Skip support through their Discord
#### **Contact appropriate support**
   - **Check the [dYdX Status Page](https://status.dydx.exchange)** for any known issues
   - **Join the [dYdX Discord](https://discord.gg/dydx)** for community support
   - **Open a support ticket** via the dYdX interface
   - **Skip issues:** [Skip Discord](https://discord.gg/skip-protocol)
   - **Noble issues:** [Noble Discord](https://discord.gg/noble)

Remember to include transaction details, wallet addresses, and a clear description of the issue for faster resolution.

## **Best Practices**

1. **Always start with a small test transaction** when using a new deposit or withdrawal method
2. **Keep your wallet connected** to dYdX frontend for auto-sweeping
3. **Save transaction hashes** for all operations
4. **Double-check all addresses** before confirming transactions
5. **Ensure your destination wallet supports** the asset you're withdrawing
6. **For large transfers, use Skip Go** instead of Skip Go Fast for better reliability
7. **Always move funds from sub account to main account** before initiating withdrawals
8. **Understand third-party dependencies** in your chosen transfer route:
   - Skip relies on their own solver network and DEX integrations
   - IBC transfers depend on the Cosmos relayer infrastructure
   - Coinbase deposits rely on Coinbase's infrastructure and Noble's IBC integration
9. **Monitor relayer and bridge status** during high network congestion periods
10. **Have backup withdrawal methods** in case one bridge or relayer network experiences issues
