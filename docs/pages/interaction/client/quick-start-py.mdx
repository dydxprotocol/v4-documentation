# Quick Start with Python

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and start using the dYdX API Python library.

::::steps

## Install Python3 and Poetry

Choose and install [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs#installing-with-the-official-installer) for your system.

## Clone the dydx client repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dydxprotocol/v4-clients.git
```

## Install all dependencies

Go to the Python client library.

```bash
cd v4-clients/v4-client-py-v2
```

Install the project dependencies using the following command:

```bash
poetry install
```

## Run an example

Now, we can run an example file. Let's run `example/accounts_endpoint.py` file.

```bash
poetry run python -m examples.account_endpoints
```
