# Wallet Setup

To manage your accounts, issue orders, and perform other operations that are required to be signed, a Wallet is required. To instantiate a Wallet, you must first have your associated __mnemonic__.

<Details title="Unification plan">
- The Python client requires the use of an address to setup the Wallet. However, the address can only be fetched using a Wallet. The address is derived from the mnemonic (address < public key < private key < mnemonic).
- Wallet, accounts, subaccounts are all handled differently among the clients. Probably the Rust client handles this best, giving the user more control:
    1. There is a `Wallet`;
    2. The `Wallet` is used to derive an `Account` by index (each `Account` is associated with a keypair);
    3. An `Account` is used to derive a `Subaccount` by index. A `Subaccount` is employed to create orders.

::::steps

## Getting the mnemonic

A Wallet is setup using your secret __mnemonic__ phrase. A __mnemonic__ is a set of 24 words to back up and access your account.

You can fetch your __mnemonic__ from the [dYdX Frontend](https://dydx.trade). After logging in, follow the instructions in "Export secret phrase", accessed by clicking your address in the upper right corner.

For the purpose of this guide, lets copy and store the __mnemonic__ in a `mnemonic.txt` file. 

:::warning
Handle your __mnemonic__ in a secure manner. __Do not share__ it with other parties. Do not commit your __mnemonic__ to a public VCS like GitHub. Access to your __mnemonic__ provides access to your account and funds. 
:::

## Read the mnemonic

Lets start coding. Load the mnemonic into a string variable. This assumes the mnemonic is stored in a text file.

:::code-group

```python [Python]
mnemonic = open('mnemonic.txt').read().strip()
```

```typescript [TypeScript]
const mnemonic = require('fs').readFileSync('mnemonic.txt', 'utf8').trim();
```

```rust [Rust]
let mnemonic = std::fs::read_to_string("mnemonic.txt").unwrap().trim().to_string();
```

:::

## Create the Wallet

Use the __mnemonic__ to create a Wallet instance capable of signing transactions.

:::code-group

```python [Python]
from dydx_v4_client.key_pair import KeyPair
from dydx_v4_client.wallet import Wallet

# Define your address.
address = Wallet(KeyPair.from_mnemonic(mnemonic), 0, 0).address()

# Create a Wallet with updated parameters required for trading
wallet = await Wallet.from_mnemonic(node, mnemonic, address)
```

```typescript [TypeScript]
import { BECH32_PREFIX, LocalWallet } from '@dydxprotocol/v4-client-js';

const wallet = await LocalWallet.fromMnemonic(mnemonic, BECH32_PREFIX);
```

```rust [Rust]
use dydx::node::Wallet;

let wallet = Wallet::from_mnemonic(&mnemonic)?;
```

## Instantiate a Subaccount

:::note
This step is not required in the Python client.
:::

When issuing orders, the relevant Subaccount must be chosen to place the order under. A Subaccount is associated with an Account, and is meant to provide trade isolation against your other Subaccounts and enhance funds management.
See more about [Accounts and Subaccounts](/concepts/trading/accounts).

:::code-group

```python [Python]
# Not required. The `wallet` instance created above already contains the necessary information.
# The Subaccount to be used is defined using an integer when creating an order.
```

```typescript [TypeScript]
import { SubaccountInfo } from '@dydxprotocol/v4-client-js';

const subaccount = new SubaccountInfo(wallet, 0);
```

```rust [Rust]
// Create an `Account` instance for the account index 0. This `Account` has updated parameters required for trading.
let account = wallet.account(0, &mut node).await?;

// Create a `Subaccount` instance for the subaccount index 0.
let subaccount = account.subaccount(0)?;
```

:::

:::info
By default, both Python and TypeScript client Wallets will derive and use the Account indexed at 0.
