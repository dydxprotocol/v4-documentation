# Integration Guide

This guide outlines the development of a perpetual trading front-end application using the dYdX v4 application chain APIs.
It covers backend data interpretation and rendering for end users, as well as trade execution.
While maintaining a high-level perspective, it addresses specific details as needed.
For in-depth implementation details, refer to the dYdX source repository, where dYdX Trading Inc. maintains the trading application's source code for web, iOS, and Android platforms.

## Overview of dYdX Repositories

The following repos contain the source code for the dYdX client applications. They can serve as a good reference if you are wondering about the implementation details:

## Main applications

::::steps

### [v4-web](https://github.com/dydxprotocol/v4-web).

The web application. This is the React application that powers the https://dydx.trade site. It references the v4-client-js repo for read/write data from the validator.

### [v4-native-ios](https://github.com/dydxprotocol/v4-native-ios).

The iOS application written in Swift It’s powered by the abacus library for its core trading logic. It also uses the v4-client-js for read/write data from the validator, and the cartera-ios library to interact with mobile wallet apps.

### [v4-native-android](https://github.com/dydxprotocol/v4-native-android).

The Android application written in Kotlin. Same with the iOS app, it uses abacus at its core, and use the v4-client-js for read/write data from the validator. Cartera-android is used to interact with mobile wallet apps.

## Support libraries

::::steps

### [v4-client-js](https://github.com/dydxprotocol/v4-clients/tree/main/v4-client-js).

Typescript library that wraps the common functions to query and write to the validator/blockchain. It takes a user’s mnemonic and then can send transactions to the validator on the user's behalf. It’s responsible for all data directly flowing in between the client applications and the validator.

### [abacus](https://github.com/dydxprotocol/v4-abacus).

Kotlin library that powers the core trading logic of the iOS and Android applications. The library pulls the data from the indexer and executes transactions by calling v4-client-js.

### [v4-localization](https://github.com/dydxprotocol/v4-localization).

Contains localization data used by all client applications. There is no application logic.
