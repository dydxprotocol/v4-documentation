| Parameter     | Location  | Type  | Required  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| `key`         | query     | [u8]  | false     | key is a value returned in PageResponse.next_key to begin querying the next page most efficiently. Only one of offset or key should be set.                                                                                       |
| `offset`      | query     | [u64] | false     | offset is a numeric offset that can be used when key is unavailable. It is less efficient than using key. Only one of offset or key should be set.                                                                                |
| `limit`       | query     | [u64] | false     | limit is the total number of results to be returned in the result page. If left empty it will default to a value to be set by each app.                                                                                           |
| `count_total` | query     | bool  | false     | count_total is set to true to indicate that the result set should include a count of the total number of items available for pagination in UIs. count_total is only respected when offset is used. It is ignored when key is set. |
| `reverse`     | query     | bool  | false     | reverse is set to true if results are to be returned in the descending order.                                                                                                                                                     |
