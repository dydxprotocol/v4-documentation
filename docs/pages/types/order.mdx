# Order

Order represents a single order belonging to a `Subaccount` for a particular `ClobPair`.

`order_id`: [OrderId] <Opt/>
- The unique ID of this order
- Meant to be unique across all orders

`side`: [OrderSide]
- The direction of the order (buy or sell)

`quantums`: [u64]
- The size of this order in base quantums
- Must be a multiple of `ClobPair.StepBaseQuantums` (where `ClobPair.Id = orderId.ClobPairId`)

`subticks`: [u64]
- The price level that this order will be placed at on the orderbook, in subticks
- Must be a multiple of `ClobPair.SubticksPerTick` (where `ClobPair.Id = orderId.ClobPairId`)

`time_in_force`: [i32]
- The time in force of this order

`reduce_only`: bool
- Enforces that the order can only reduce the size of an existing position
- If a ReduceOnly order would change the side of the existing position, its size is reduced to that of the remaining size of the position
- If existing orders on the book with ReduceOnly would already close the position, the least aggressive (out-of-the-money) ReduceOnly orders are resized and canceled first

`client_metadata`: [u32]
- Set of bit flags set arbitrarily by clients and ignored by the protocol
- Used by indexer to infer information about a placed order

`condition_type`: [i32]
- The type of condition for this order

`conditional_order_trigger_subticks`: [u64]
- The price at which this order will be triggered, in subticks
- If condition_type is CONDITION_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED, this value must be 0
- If this value is nonzero, condition_type cannot be CONDITION_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED
- Must be a multiple of ClobPair.SubticksPerTick (where `ClobPair.Id = orderId.ClobPairId`)

`twap_parameters`: [TwapParameters] <Opt/>
> **Note:** This field will be introduced in a future version of the API (v9.0).
- Configuration for a TWAP order
- Must be set for TWAP orders
- Ignored for all other order types


`builder_code_parameters`: [BuilderCodeParameters] <Opt/>
- Metadata for the partner or builder of an order specifying the fees charged

`good_til_oneof`: [GoodTilOneof] <Opt/>
- Information about when the order expires
